# Introduction

### About us

Lido on Solana is a Lido-DAO governed liquid staking protocol for the Solana blockchain.
Anyone who stakes their SOL tokens with Lido will be issued an on-chain representation of SOL staking position with Lido validators, called stSOL. We will work to integrate stSOL widely into the Solana DeFi ecosystem to enable stSOL users to make use of their staked assets in a variety of applications.

Lido on Solana gives you:
- **Liquidity** — No delegation/activation delays and the ability to sell your staked tokens
- **One-click staking** — No complicated steps
- **Decentralized** security — Assets spread across the industry’s leading validators chosen by the Lido DAO

### About sdk
